<h2>• <span style="font-size: 20px;">Machine Learning (ML) Models</span></h2>
<p>The platform includes <strong>four advanced Machine Learning (ML) models</strong> that predict emissions and guide the coal mines towards achieving carbon neutrality. These models are trained using extensive data and algorithms that provide accurate, real-time predictions for various emission sources:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fuel</strong> - Predicting emissions based on fuel consumption patterns in mining operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Electricity</strong> - Estimating the emissions tied to electricity usage, crucial for minimizing energy wastage.</li>
  <li><strong>Transport</strong> - Offering predictions for transportation emissions based on logistical operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Explosives</strong> - Forecasting emissions from explosives, which play a significant role in mining.</li>
</ul>
<p>These models generate both <strong>monthly</strong> and <strong>annual</strong> predictions, allowing stakeholders to track progress toward carbon neutrality. Additionally, the ML models suggest <strong>optimal pathways</strong> to achieve carbon neutrality by identifying trends, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement in the mining processes. The platform’s predictive power ensures a more dynamic approach to emission management, based on ever-changing mining conditions and operational data.</p>
